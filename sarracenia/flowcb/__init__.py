1st draft of a v03 plugin method: flow_callback

sample call:

flow_callback sarracenia.flowcb.name.Name

will instantiate an object of that type whose appropriately name methods
will be called at the right time.


__init__ accepts options as an argument.

options is a dictionary of settings, used to override default behaviour

a setting is declared:

set sarracenia.flowcb.filter.log.Log.level debug

(the prefix for the setting matches the type hierarchy in flow_callback)

the plugin should get the setting:

    options.level = 'debug'


worklist given to on_plugins...

    worklist.incoming --> new messages to continue processing
    worklist.ok       --> successfully processed
    worklist.rejected --> messages to not be further processed.
    worklist.failed   --> messages for which processing failed.
                          failed messages will be retried.


Initially all messages are placed in incoming.
if a plugin decides:

- a message is not relevant, it is moved to the rejected worklist. 
- all processing has been done, it moves it to the ok worklist
- an operation failed and it should be retried later, append it to the failed
  worklist

Do not remove any message from all lists, only move messages between them.
   it is necessary to put rejected messages in the appropriate worklist
   so they can be acknowledged as received. Messages can only removed after ack.
