<p>Sarracenia pumps form a network. The network uses mqp brokers as a transfer
manager which sends advertisements in one direction and report messages in the
opposite direction. Administrators configure the paths that data flows through
at each pump, as each broker acts independently, managing transfers from
transfer engines it can reach, with no knowledge of the overall network. The
locations of pump and the directions of traffic flow are chosen to work with
permitted flows. Ideally, no firewall exceptions are needed.</p>
<p>Sarracenia does no data transport. It is a management layer to co-ordinate
the use of transport layers. So to get a running pump, actual transport mechanisms
need to be set up as well. The two mechanisms currently supported are web
servers and SFTP. In the simplest case, all of the components are on the
same server, but there is no need for that. The broker could be on a
different server from both ends of a given hop of a data transfer.</p>
<p>The best way for data transfers to occur is to avoid polling. It is more
efficient if writers can be coaxed into emitting appropriate sr_post messages.
Similarly, when delivering, it is ideal if the receivers use sr_subscribe, and
an on_file plugin to trigger their further processing, so that the file is
handed to them without polling. This is the most efficient way of working, but
it is understood that not all software can be made co-operative. Tools to poll
in order to start transport flows are sr_poll, and sr_watch.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Linux is the main deployment target, and the only platform on which
server configurations are deployed. Other platforms are used as client end points.
This isn´t a limitation, it is just what is used and tested. Implementations of
the pump on Windows should work, they just are not tested.</p>

<p>The flow algorithm isn’t confined to a single process. Many processes can run
the same flow configuration. For the sarra, sender, shovel and subscribe, components,
one sets the <em>instance</em> setting to the number of processes to run and
consume from the configured <em>queue</em> that they share.</p>
<p>The poll, post, and watch components, by contrast, are limited to a single process
on any given server. In the table above, there is a note about <em>has_vip</em>. When
there are multiple servers participating in a configuration, the vip directive
can be used to have the servers co-operate to provide a single service (where
only one server is active at a time.) For most components, The vip directive in
a configuration file defines a virtual ip address that a server must have
actively on it for that component to be active. If Sarracenia detects that the
interface is not present on the server, then the component will run in passive
mode.</p>
<p>For almost all components, passive mode means that no processing will occur.
it will just passively check once in a while if it has obtained the vip, and
if not, will stand by indefinitely.</p>
<p>The exception to this is poll, which works differently. in poll, when you
do not have the vip the following algorithmic loop will continue:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>gather</p></li>
<li><p>filter</p></li>
<li><p>after_accept</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The poll’s gather and fileter being alive and kicking even in passive mode,
allows it to subscribe to the exchange it is posting to and update it’s cache
of files posted from the messages, so that if it ever does become active, its
state is current.</p>

<p>It is helpful to understand a bit about AMQP to work with Sarracenia.
AMQP is a vast and interesting topic in its own right. No attempt is
made to explain all of it here. This section just provides a little context, and introduces
only background concepts needed to understand and/or use Sarracenia. For more information

<p>An AMQP Server is called a Broker. <em>Broker</em> is sometimes used to refer to the software,
other times server running the broker software (same confusion as <em>web server</em>.) In the
above diagram, AMQP vocabulary is in Orange, and Sarracenia terms are in blue. There are
many different broker software implementations. We use rabbitmq. We are not trying to
be rabbitmq specific, but management functions differ between implementations.</p>

<p>MQTT is actually a better match to Sarracenia than AMQP, as it is entirely
based on hierarchical topics, while topics are only one among a variety of
choices for routing methods in AMQP.</p>

<p>A description of the conventional flow of messages through exchanges on a pump:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>subscribers usually bind to the xpublic exchange to get the main data feed.
This is the default in sr_subscribe.</p></li>
<li><p>A user named Alice will have two exchanges:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>xs_Alice the exhange where Alice posts her file notifications and report messages.(via many tools)</p></li>
<li><p>xr_Alice the exchange where Alice reads her report messages from (via sr_report)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>usually sr_sarra will read from xs_alice, retrieve the data corresponding to Alice´s <em>post</em>
message, and make it available on the pump, by re-announcing it on the xpublic exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>sr_winnow may pull from xs_alice instead, but follows the same pattern as sr_sarra.</p></li>
<li><p>usually, sr_audit –users will cause rr_alice2xreport shovel configurations to
read xs_alice and copy the report messages onto the private xreport exchange.</p></li>
<li><p>Admins can point sr_report at the xreport exchange to get system-wide monitoring.
Alice will not have permission to do that, she can only look at xl_Alice, which should have
the report messages pertinent to her.</p></li>
<li><p>rr_xreport2source shovel configurations auto-generated by sr_audit look at messages for the
local Alice user in xreport, and sends them to xl_Alice.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose of these conventions is to encourage a reasonably secure means of operating.
If a message is taken from xs_Alice, then the process doing the reading is responsible for
ensuring that it is tagged as coming from Alice on this cluster. This prevents certain
types of ´spoofing´ as messages can only be posted by proper owners.</p>

<section id="users-and-roles">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Users and Roles</a><a class="headerlink" href="#users-and-roles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Usernames for pump authentication are significant in that they are visible to all.
They are used in the directory path on public trees, as well as to authenticate to the broker.
They need to be understandable. They are often wider scope than a person…
perhaps call them ‘Accounts’. It can be elegant to configure the same usernames
for use in transport engines.</p>
<p>All Account names should be unique, but nothing will avoid clashes when sources originate from
different pump networks, and clients at different destinations. In practice, name clashes are
addressed by routing to avoid two different sources’ with the same name having their
data offerings combined on a single tree. On the other hand, name clashes are not always an error.
Use of a common source account name on different clusters may be used to implement folders that
are shared between the two accounts with the same name.</p>
<p>Pump users are defined with the <em>declare</em> option. Each option starts with the <em>declare</em>
keyword, followed by the specified role, and lastly the user name which has that role.
Role can be one of:</p>
<dl>
<dt>subscriber</dt><dd><p>A subscriber is user that can only subscribe to data and report messages. Not permitted to inject data.
Each subscriber gets an xs_&lt;user&gt; named exchange on the pump, where if a user is named <em>Acme</em>,
the corresponding exchange will be <em>xs_Acme</em>. This exchange is where an sr_subscribe
process will send its report messages.</p>
<p>By convention/default, the <em>anonymous</em> user is created on all pumps to permit subscription without
a specific account.</p>
</dd>
<dt>source</dt><dd><p>A user permitted to subscribe or originate data. A source does not necessarily represent
one person or type of data, but rather an organization responsible for the data produced.
So if an organization gathers and makes available ten kinds of data with a single contact
email or phone number for questions about the data and it’s availability, then all of
those collection activities might use a single ‘source’ account.</p>
<p>Each source gets a xs_&lt;user&gt; exchange for injection of data posts, and,
similar to a subscriber, to send report messages about processing and receipt
of data. Each source is able to view all of the messages for data it has
injected, but the location where all of these messages are available varies
according to administrator configuration of report routing. A source may
inject data on pumpA, but may subscribe to reports on a different pump. The
reports corresponding to the data the source injected are written in
exchange xl_&lt;user&gt;.</p>
<p>When data is first injected, the path is modified by sarracenia to prepend a
fixed upper part of the directory tree. The first level directory is the day
of ingest into the network in YYYYMMDD format. The second level directory is
the source name. So for a user Alice, injecting data on May 4th, 2016, the
root of the directory tree is:  20160504/Alice. Note that all pumps are
expected to run in the UTC timezone (widely, but inaccurately, referred to
as GMT.)</p>
<p>There are daily directories because there is a system-wide life-time for data, it is deleted
after a standard number of days, data is just deleted from the root.</p>
<p>Since all clients will see the directories, and therefore client configurations will include them.
It would be wise to consider the account name public, and relatively static.</p>
<p>Sources determine who can access their data, by specifying which cluster to send the data to.</p>
</dd>
<dt>feeder</dt><dd><p>a user permitted to subscribe or originate data, but understood to represent a pump.
This local pump user would be used to, run processes like sarra, report routing shovels, etc…</p>
</dd>
<dt>admin</dt><dd><p>a user permitted to manage the local pump.
It is the real rabbitmq-server administrator.
The administrator runs sr_audit to create/delete
exchanges, users, or clean unused queues… etc.</p>
